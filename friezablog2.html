		<p class="bio"><strong>Frieza</strong> is a fictional character in the <strong><em>Dragon Ball</em></strong> manga series created by <strong>Akira Toriyama</strong>. Freeza makes his debut in Chapter #247: Dark Clouds Swirl Over Planet Namek (暗雲うずまくナメック星 An'un Uzumaku Namekkusei), first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on November 6, 1989,as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful being in the universe.</p>

	<p class="bio">Despite not appearing until the manga's second half, Freeza is widely considered to be the most iconic antagonist from the series due to effectively serving as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story, such as Goku's arrival on Earth, the Saiyans landing on Earth, and subsequently the main characters going to planet Namek. He is also directly responsible for the murder of Burdock, the genocide of the Saiyan race, and the second death of Kuririn, arguably making him Goku's most personal and significant enemy.</p>
	
	<p class="bio">Freeza, a broker who forcibly takes over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the "worst kind of people." Toriyama purposely does not draw bad guys so unscrupulous that it affects one psychologically, although he admits Freeza is close. Therefore he paid special attention to how Freeza spoke; because villans typically speak rudely, he gave him polite speech making for an unsettling contrast with his cruelty. The character's name is a pun on freezer, and because of this the members of the Ginyu Force are named after items one would normally put in a refrigerator. The Shenlong Times issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide guidebook, says that Freeza was modeled after Toriyama's editor at the time, Yū Kondō.</p>

	<p class="bio">Freeza possesses four transformation forms, each one being quite different and more powerful from the previous. It is implied that Freeza's fourth form is actually his basic one, with the other three being transformations that suppress his power in order to conserve it. Toriyama revealed that he did not think to have Freeza transform until about midway through. He said he has a habit of making characters gradually more tough and complex-looking, until finally making them very sleek, as it is a pain to draw them if their appearance is too complex. The author confirmed this is why Freeza's third and most intricate form is only shown for a short time, and joked that three transformations might be one too many.</p>
	
	<p class="bio">Freeza is capable of moving at superhuman speeds, flying, and has quick reflexes. Like most characters in the series, he can harness a supernatural energy known as Ki and manipulate it into powerful and devastating concussive beams of said energy, with which he is able to destroy planets with relative ease. Some of Freeza's signature ki techniques include the Death Beam (デスビーム Desu Bīmu), a sharp piercing beam from his finger, and the Death Ball (デスボール Desu Bōru), a large energy sphere he used to destroy planet Namek. He is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space, and also seems to possess some form of telekinesis, being able to lift opponents without touching them and cause them to explode.</p>

	<p class="bio">Freeza's power is so great over time, that his body could not comfortably contain it and a series of physical transformations were developed that limit his actual strength. While changing shape from his "first-form", each alteration builds on the previous. In all, Freeza has three transformed states, each with increasing power, some larger than others and each resulting in different physical attributes.</p><br>
	
	<p class="header" id="abilities">ABILITIES</p><br>

	<p class="header2">First Form</p>
	<p class="bio">Freeza's first three forms, from right to left.
	In his weakest form, Freeza is a relatively short humanoid with a large chestnut-shaped skull and two horns. He also has a tail with a spiked end, as well as having three talon-like toes. Freeza wears the same upper-body armor and shorts that many of his subordinates are shown to wear, and while traveling, often gives the appearance of weakness by exclusively using his hoverchair for transportation, leaving his henchmen to do his "dirty work". Though frail in comparison with his succeeding forms, Freeza still boasts sufficient force to destroy planets. While shifting to his next stage, Freeza breaks his battle-jacket, revealing a natural white armor covering his chest and shoulders.</p><br>

	<p class="header2">Second Form</p>
	<p class="bio">His second form is much larger, both in height and muscle mass. He grows longer horns, which now instead of protruding sideways from his head curve sharply upwards into near right angles. Freeza does not have any trouble taking out Vegeta, Kuririn and Son Gohan. However, Freeza notices that Piccolo's power level is about equal to his own level, leaving Freeza with no choice but to transform again. This form largely resembles his father King Cold.</p><br>

	<p class="header2">Third Form</p>
	<p class="bio">Freeza's third form is again more brutish, with an extremely elongated skull (like an Alien). His facial features contort and change, with his nose melding into his mouth to form a crude beak. His original horns recede and are now white in color, erupting in pairs along the length of his head. His tail tip, which had been cut off by Kuririn, did not regenerate and he now has a slight hunch. Although his tail was surprisingly not regenerated, the rest of his wounds disappeared as if nothing ever touched him.</p><br>

	<p class="header2">Fourth Form</p>
	<p class="bio">Drastically differing from his previous transformations, in his final, true form Freeza instead regresses, becoming shorter and less bulky. His horns and spikes disappear with his physique becoming entirely streamlined and his skin is now a pure, solid white with purple sections on his head, shoulders, forearms, chest and shins. All injuries taken in other forms are healed. This is the form that allows him to release his full potential. Freeza is also able to attain 100% power of this form, his muscle mass becoming engorged compared to his previously sleek frame. This is the peak of Freeza's natural potential, and the maximum amount of power his body can output. However, to obtain this power his body is subjected to a muscle strain, which slowly lowers his energy, and slowing him down until he cannot compete with Super Saiyan Goku anymore. This transformation is therefore not suitable for prolonged combat, with Freeza trying to finish the fight as quickly as possible by destroying the planet Namek.</p><br>

	<p class="header2">Mecha Freeza</p>
	<p class="bio">After being cut in half by his own attack and being caught in Namek's huge explosion, what remains of the still-living Freeza is salvaged and rebuilt with cybernetic enhancements by scientists under the order of King Cold, this form is referred to as Mecha Freeza (メカフリーザ) in video games. The whole of the lower half of his body and right side of his face are replaced, as is his left arm from the shoulder down, with scarring and metal accoutrements covering what little was left of his organic self. It is stated that these enhancements have made him even more powerful. However, his full power is never shown, since he is easily destroyed by Trunks.</p><br>

	<p class="header2">Golden Freeza</p>
	<p class="bio">Freeza obtains another transformation in the 2015 film Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' and Dragon Ball Super. According to Freeza, his fifth transformation is achieved after undergoing intensive training for four months, enabling him to gain the strength to progress even further beyond his previous transformations by drawing out all of his latent power (as he had never trained a day in his life beforehand).[24] In this form, Freeza's physique is similar to his previous fourth form except his skin is now a golden color as opposed to white, with purple sections on his head, chest, forearms and shins, thus he is known as "Golden Freeza" (ゴールデンフリーザ Gōruden Furīza) in this form. In this form at peak power, Freeza is able to overpower Goku in his Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form with relative ease. This form however drains his energy much like when he used 100% of his power in his fourth form due to him not training himself further to become accustomed to the form, and thus is also unsuitable for prolonged combat, as he soon finds himself unable to compete with Goku and Vegeta in their Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan forms.</p><br><br>

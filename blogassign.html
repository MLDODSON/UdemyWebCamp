	<p class="quote">Friez is a fictional character in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. Freeza makes his debut in Chapter #247: Dark Clouds Swirl Over Planet Namek (暗雲うずまくナメック星 An'un Uzumaku Namekkusei), first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on November 6, 1989, as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful being in the universe.</p>

	<p>Despite not appearing until the manga's second half, Freeza is widely considered to be the most iconic antagonist from the series due to effectively serving as the catalyst of many of the events depicted in the story, such as Goku's arrival on Earth, the Saiyans landing on Earth, and subsequently the main characters going to planet Namek. He is also directly responsible for the murder of Burdock, the genocide of the Saiyan race, and the second death of Kuririn, arguably making him Goku's most personal and significant enemy.</p>
	
	<p>Freeza, a broker who forcibly takes over planets to resell them, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the "worst kind of people." Toriyama purposely does not draw bad guys so unscrupulous that it affects one psychologically, although he admits Freeza is close. Therefore he paid special attention to how Freeza spoke; because villans typically speak rudely, he gave him polite speech making for an unsettling contrast with his cruelty. The character's name is a pun on freezer, and because of this the members of the Ginyu Force are named after items one would normally put in a refrigerator. The Shenlong Times issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide guidebook, says that Freeza was modeled after Toriyama's editor at the time, Yū Kondō.</p>

	<p class="quote">Freeza possesses four transformation forms, each one being quite different and more powerful from the previous. It is implied that Freeza's fourth form is actually his basic one, with the other three being transformations that suppress his power in order to conserve it. Toriyama revealed that he did not think to have Freeza transform until about midway through. He said he has a habit of making characters gradually more tough and complex-looking, until finally making them very sleek, as it is a pain to draw them if their appearance is too complex. The author confirmed this is why Freeza's third and most intricate form is only shown for a short time, and joked that three transformations might be one too many.</p>

	<p>Freeza is capable of moving at superhuman speeds, flying, and has quick reflexes. Like most characters in the series, he can harness a supernatural energy known as Ki and manipulate it into powerful and devastating concussive beams of said energy, with which he is able to destroy planets with relative ease. Some of Freeza's signature ki techniques include the Death Beam (デスビーム Desu Bīmu), a sharp piercing beam from his finger, and the Death Ball (デスボール Desu Bōru), a large energy sphere he used to destroy planet Namek. He is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space, and also seems to possess some form of telekinesis, being able to lift opponents without touching them and cause them to explode.</p>
	
	<p>Freeza's power is so great over time, that his body could not comfortably contain it and a series of physical transformations were developed that limit his actual strength. While changing shape from his "first-form", each alteration builds on the previous. In all, Freeza has three transformed states, each with increasing power, some larger than others and each resulting in different physical attributes.</p>
